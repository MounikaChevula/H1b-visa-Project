Query 6:Find the percentage and the count of each case status on total applications for each year. Create a graph depicting the pattern of All the cases over the period of time.

sol:
----
bag1 = load '/user/hive/warehouse/project.db/h1b_final' using PigStorage() as (s_no:int,case_status:chararray,employer_name:chararray,soc_name:chararray,job_title:chararray,full_time_position:chararray,prevailing_wage:int,year:chararray,worksite:chararray,longitude:double,latitude:double);
